    <p>
      SCENE: <i>Kitchen at Woodbarrow Farm. An ideal old farmhouse kitchen. From
      the smoke-blackened ceiling beams hang huge sides of bacon, strings of
      onions, and herbs, and poultry. Over the great fireplace are the guns, and
      in profusion everywhere are the homely furnishings of a prosperous
      farmhouse kitchen. A huge fire burns r. in old-fashioned fireplace, with
      settle on each side. Door l.c. at back opening on corner of farmyard.
      Latticed window looking out on yard to r. of door. Table r.c. piled with
      linen waiting to be folded. Linen press l. Door l. below press. Settle in
      front of press. Mrs. Rollitt at table r.c. discovered ironing. She folds
      up clothes as she finishes with them, and crosses and places them one by
      one in press l.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Rachael! Rachael!! (Crossing l. then crosses to r. at back
      of table r.c.) Ah, drat the girls&mdash;alius philandering about with the
      boys when they&rsquo;re wanted. Rachael!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Enter Rachael, she comes slowly forward to l.c.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RACH.</b> Did you call, ma&rsquo;am?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (At table.) Did I call? Why thee be getting deaf in thee
      old age sure, Rachael.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RACH.</b> I was in the dairy, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> In the dairy! Well, and the dairy bean&rsquo;t a mile off, be it?
      I expect there wur Joe&rsquo;s thick head &rsquo;twixt you and the sound of my
      voice, warn&rsquo;t there? Rach. No, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Whose wur it, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RACH.</b> Ichabod&rsquo;s, ma&rsquo;am. I&mdash;I mean Mr. Ichabod was helping me,
      ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> What at? (<i>Pause.</i>) How often am I to tell &rsquo;ee
      I won&rsquo;t have that hulking scamp hanging about here after his work&rsquo;s done.
      Do &rsquo;ee understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RACH.</b> Yes, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Here&rsquo;s getting on for 8 o&rsquo;clock, and thee master may be
      home any minute as hungry as a hunter, poor lad, and noothing ready for
      his supper. Get down the ham (<i>Rachael goes to fireplace r.</i>), and
      bring me in the frying-pan and I&rsquo;ll do it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RACH.</b> (<i>Turning to go.</i>) Yes, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> And don&rsquo;t be half-an-hour about it. Is Ichabod gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RACH.</b> Oh yes, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Mrs. R. turns to her work, Ichabod appears at door at hack, with a
      trout in his hand. Rachael catching sight of him stops, and motions him to
      go away.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Ah, a good thing for un as he has, if I catch un here again
      to-night, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;(<i>Rachael makes sign to Ichabod who is up c. Mrs.
      R. looks at Rachael</i>)&mdash;Lord help the lass, be she struck foolish?
      Bean&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee agoing? Rach. Yes, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Well then, do ut. Thee keeps on saying, &ldquo;yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; &ldquo;yes,
      ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and there &rsquo;ee sticks. (<i>Drops eyes. Rachael makes sign to
      Ichabod. Mrs. Rollitt catches her.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Ichabod does not understand Rachel, and tries to explain to her in
      pantomime about the trout, which he holds up and points to. Mrs. Rollitt
      follows Rachael&rsquo;s eyes, and sees Ichabod. Rachael is struck dumb, and
      Ichabod grins and pulls his hair.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> If thee don&rsquo;t take theeself off pretty, soon, my boy, I&rsquo;ll
      do that for un. (<i>He makes no answer but continues pulling his hair and
      grinning, making a few steps forward and still holding out the trout. Mrs.
      Rollitt advances to him slowly.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>Comes c.</i>) How often am I to tell &rsquo;ee I won&rsquo;t
      have &rsquo;ee loafing about here after thee work&rsquo;s done, and thee mother
      waiting for thee at home, thee good-for-nothing young&mdash;(<i>eyeing the
      trout</i>)&mdash;aye, but he be a bonny un that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ICH.</b> Thowt maybe he&rsquo;d do for the measter&rsquo;s supper, ma&rsquo;am. He wur
      a-having his own not half-an-hour agone, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>l. with fish in hand.</i>) Her be a three pound un,
      Ichabod.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ICH.</b> As full as an egg, her be, just. Thee feel her, ma&rsquo;am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Ah, well, I won&rsquo;t say but what thee art a thoughtful lad,
      Ichabod, and it will be main good for thee measter&rsquo;s supper. See there&rsquo;s a
      clear fire. (<i>Crosses r.Enter Deborah from staircase L.</i>) Rachael,
      and bring me the stew pan and we&rsquo;ll boil un.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> No, don&rsquo;t boil it, aunt. (<i>Takes fish from Mrs. R.</i>) Let
      me fry it. Allen alius likes &lsquo;em best that way. (<i>Goes r. c. up stage.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> So un does, lass, so un does. Ah, thee knaw what the lad
      loikes, thee shall fry it. (<i>Hands trout to Deb.</i>) And I&rsquo;ll finish
      the linen while I&rsquo;ve got my hand on it. (<i>At back of table r.c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Allen will like that, I know. Where did you get it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ICH.</b> (<i>Confused and grinning.</i>) What, me, Miss?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Not poached, I hope, Ichabod?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ICH.</b> (<i>Offended.</i>) Poached, Miss? No, Miss, I wur trying to
      teach a fly of mine to swim, that wur all, Miss, and when I took un from
      the water there wur this thing hanging on to the end of un, and I couldn&rsquo;t
      get &lsquo;un off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>At table r. c.</i>) Thee&rsquo;d best stop awhile now,
      Ichabod, and the girls will gie un a bit sup. Thee mother will be main
      glad to be rid o&rsquo; ye a bit, I take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ICH.</b> Thank ye, ma&rsquo;am. Mother&rsquo;s alius glad to be rid of me at supper
      toime. (<i>To Deborah.) Gie me un, Miss, I&rsquo;ll clean un for ye. (</i>Takes
      fish from Deborah, goes down l. at back of settle.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RACH.</b> Shall I cook un, Miss?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Na, na, thee bring the pan in here, Rachael, I woan&rsquo;t trust
      the master&rsquo;s supper to &lsquo;ee, while there&rsquo;s a pair of breeches about the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>RACH.</b> (<i>Crosses l. with a toss of her head.) I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
      want &lsquo;em there at all. (</i>Picks up buckets near door l. down stage.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Ah, thee wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; the lad theer wi&rsquo;out &lsquo;em! Go and do
      as I tell &lsquo;ee.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rachael hits Ichabod with bucket. Exeunt Rachael and Ichabod l. door down
      stage.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b><b>MRS. R.</b> The lad will enjoy it all the more if thee
      cook it for un. Ah. and he do enjoy his food too. It do me good to see un
      eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> He does you a lot of good that way, doesn&rsquo;t he, aunt?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>Laughing.&lsquo;</i>) Ah, yes, he be like his father wur
      before him, a rare trencher man. Ah, but they&rsquo;re better than those as
      doesn&rsquo;t eat much, but sits a-turning and a-smelling, and a-grumbling at
      everything that&rsquo;s set before them, for all the world like an overfed
      turkey cock trying to eat potato peelings. Thee wean&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; much trouble
      looking arter un when I&rsquo;m gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Goes to fireplace R.</i>) Oh, aunt, how naughty you are,
      always talking of being &ldquo;gone,&rdquo; just as if you were an old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> No, no, lass, I bean&rsquo;t talking of being gone now. I&rsquo;ve many
      a year before me yet, please God. But it must come sometime, thee knaws,
      and I like to think that when it do there&rsquo;ll be someone to gie the lad his
      bit of food, and look arter un loike&mdash;and, Lord, a man do want a
      power of looking arter to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>At fire R. making it up.</i>) I think that&rsquo;s why we love
      &lsquo;em, aunt, because they&rsquo;re so helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>Cross to l.</i>) Ah, maybe it is. There must be summut
      to account for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> And I suppose they be like the poultry. They get fond of us
      because we feed them. He does say I&rsquo;ve got a good hand for cooking, aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>Cross to r.</i>) Ah, yes, lass. It be a light hand for
      the kitchen and a cool hand for the dairy. It will make a good hand for a
      farmer&rsquo;s wife. (<i>Takes Deborah&rsquo;s hand at table R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> I don&rsquo;t think Allen will want a farmer&rsquo;s wife, aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Lord, whose wife should a farmer want, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Pokes fire r.</i>) I don&rsquo;t think Allen wants to be a
      farmer at all. He says he wants to be a somebody, not a nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Well, bean&rsquo;t a farmer somebody?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Somebody, aunt, but not a somebody. Allen wants to be in the
      world, you know, aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Well, and he be in the world sure, ain&rsquo;t he? Sure I think I
      ought to know. (<i>Cross to l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> No, not in the world he means, aunt. Not in the great world as
      they call it.
    </p>

      old mother. (<i>Crosses l. and sits knitting next to Purtwee.</i>)

      bust me, I have got a vacuum inside o&rsquo; me. Poached eggs?

      <b>MR. P.</b> Eh! what&rsquo;s that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Hulloa! Thee&rsquo;ve done it now. Why, Mr. Purtwee be Lord
      Netherby&rsquo;s lawyer, and he&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; thee hanged in chains on Dunkery Beacon,
      sure as fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Ah, well, you see I didn&rsquo;t poach him, I&rsquo;m only frying him.
      There&rsquo;s no law against frying fish, is there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>r.c.</i>) Aye, well, us&rsquo;ll forgive thee this time, if

    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Pleased.</i>) No! Have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I bought her this afternoon, and I got her for&mdash;(<i>l.c.,

      <b>MRS. R.</b> It&rsquo;s a funny way o&rsquo; doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I doan&rsquo;t know how her done it, but her done it. Why he
      wanted £25 for the cow at first, and when I told un her wur for Deb he
      looked as stupid as an old cow unself and said I could have her for £20,
      and then he asked me if she would like a calf. (<i>Goes R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> We could do with one. What did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Laughing.</i>) I told un her&rsquo;d better let the calf come
      down and ask for unself. (<i>Laughs boisterously.</i>) He never saw what I
      meant. (<i>All laugh.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Oh, I expect he saw it all right. Jim Whalley is a very sharp
      fellow; there was no need to insult him just because he&rsquo;d done a kind
      action. (<i>Warmly&mdash;turns away r. a little.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; said it if I&rsquo;d known. I didn&rsquo;t know thee
      was in love wi&rsquo; him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Half laughing and half indignant.</i>) Oh, don&rsquo;t be silly,
      Allen, as if I cared for Jim Whalley.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I might ha&rsquo; guessed it too. Why, I expect that&rsquo;s why thee
      wanted the cow so as to have something about the place to remind thee o&rsquo;
      un.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Oh, you great stupid!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Why, look how you&rsquo;re blushing. Look, look at her face,
      mother. (<i>Goes to back of settle r. takes up looking-glass which is

      yourself! (<i>she catches him a sound box on the ear. He puts his hand to
      his face, and crossing puts back glass.</i>) I didn&rsquo;t know thee was so
      strong. That all comes of those squab pies o&rsquo; yourn, mother, I told thee
      thee wur putting too much meat in &lsquo;em.

    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>Laughing.</i>) Ah, it&rsquo;s thy sauce lad, not my meat,

      while me and Mr. Purtwee has a look round the out-buildings. (<i>To Mr.
      Purtwee</i>) I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get hold of thee for a long time. Thee&rsquo;s
      never given us so much as a bit o&rsquo; paint for the last ten years, and the
      stable roof won&rsquo;t bear an owl on it. (<i>Goes up c. with Purtwee.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>r. near settle.</i>) Thee might show Mr. Purtwee the
      barn floor while thee&rsquo;s about it, mother. It be more like an earthquake
      than a floor.

      <b>MRS. R.</b> Oh, I be a going to show him more than he wants to see,
      don&rsquo;t thee worrit. (<i>Aside to Mr. Purtwee at door c.</i>) Ah, they&rsquo;d
      make a pretty couple, wouldn&rsquo;t they?

      Thank you, Mr. Rollitt, it is very kind of you.

      certainly! (<i>Takes it from chair off l. on staircase, crosses with it,
      and holds it for Deborah while she takes some.</i>) Jolly good butter this
      week; who made it? Thee?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Other side of plate.</i>) Of course I did! I make all the
      butter now, and the cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> What, wi&rsquo; them little hands. They don&rsquo;t look big enough to
      do anything but be kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Looking up and smiling.</i>) They can do something else,
      can&rsquo;t they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Ah! They be like the parson&rsquo;s, not as soft as they looks. (<i>Puts
      down butter on the table&mdash;pause&mdash;during which Deborah proceeds
      with her cooking, and Allen stands watching her.</i>) What a jolly little
      farmer&rsquo;s wife thee&rsquo;d make.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Yes; I only want the jolly little farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Ah, thee won&rsquo;t find many of that sort about. Farming don&rsquo;t
      pay enough for a man to get jolly on, now-a-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Oh, we have enough to eat and drink, and a little to spend on
      foolishness. You want so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Goes l.</i>) Not more than what a many has. Not more
      than a little bit of what this young Hanning-ford is coming back to&mdash;enough
      to let a man see what the world&rsquo;s like a bit, instead of being cooped oop
      all one&rsquo;s life, like an old cow, in one corner of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> But you can&rsquo;t live all over it, and one corner must be much as
      good as another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Crosses r.</i>) Ah, thee don&rsquo;t understand it, lass. Thee
      women folk can stand day arter day the same, but we lads are restless wi&rsquo;
      it. We feel as there&rsquo;s summat big and stirring going on somewhere, and we
      long to be among it&mdash;to be in the great world. It seems to call to me&mdash;(<i>puts
      foot on settle L.</i>)&mdash;to come to it, sometimes. I hear it of a
      night when I&rsquo;m watching the sheep on the hill fields. Maybe it&rsquo;s only the
      sea breaking on the rocks down by Glenthorn&mdash;or the wind among the
      old oaks, but it sounds like a distant far-off voice&mdash;(<i>gets l. of
      table R. with back to Deborah</i>)&mdash;calling to me, and it rings and
      echoes in my ears, till I feel at times that I must start up then and
      there and follow it. (<i>Deborah r. of table r. Allen l. of table r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Very gravely, laying her hand on his arm.</i>) Allen, lad,
      don&rsquo;t you remember reading one evening to us of the sirens, who in the old
      days used to haunt the sea caves, and sing so sweetly that the sailors who
      once paused to listen, were lured on and on till they were wrecked among
      the cruel rocks? May not the voices that you hear be like the singing of
      those sirens?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Maybe, lass; but the sailors couldn&rsquo;t help but follow when
      they did hear it. (<i>Sits in chair l. of table R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>After a pause.</i>) What be the matter, Allen? Thee used
      to be contented enough. Now thee&rsquo;s always talking about riches, and
      wanting to go away from the dear old farm. Somethin&rsquo;s come over thee, lad.
      (<i>Puts hand on Allen&rsquo;s shoulder.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> No, I wur allus like an old crow&mdash;(<i>Deborah takes her
      hand away</i>)&mdash;sitting on a fence, and looking at summat too far off
      to see. But thee be right partly, lass. Summat has come over me, and made
      me want what I can&rsquo;t get more than ever now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Very kindly, r.</i>) What be it? (<i>With elbows leaning
      on table, R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Rises, goes l. c.</i>) Well, I be in love, lass. (<i>Still

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>After a pause, during which she has smiled to herself with
      a happy little sigh, and clasped her hands together in a sort of little
      joyful ecstacy, unnoticed by Allen.</i>) In love!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I fancy it must be that. I think of her all day and I dream
      of her all night, and I&rsquo;m jolly miserable. (<i>At settle, R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Demurely.</i>) Have you any reason to suppose that she
      returns your affection?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I don&rsquo;t know, her&rsquo;s never said anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Me! No, I haven&rsquo;t said anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Most extraordinary that she doesn&rsquo;t propose. Have you given
      her any encouragement? (<i>Leans against settle R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Noa&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say as I have, much. (<i>Goes r.c.</i>)
      I&rsquo;ve looked at her, you know&mdash;soft like&mdash;and sighed. (<i>Does
      so.</i>) But her&rsquo;s mostly been looking t&rsquo;other way and an&rsquo;t seen it, and
      as for saying anything to her&mdash;well, I can talk to her all right
      about other things and joke and laugh wi&rsquo; her, but the moment I goes to
      say I love her&mdash;it&mdash;it seems as if I&rsquo;d got a hot potato stuck in
      my throat. (<i>Speaking as if she had, turns away to l. corner of r.table,

    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Turning and looking at him earnestly&mdash;comes to front

    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m Miss Deacon&mdash;Miss Deborah Deacon. We were
      school-fellows, you know. (<i>Timidly approaching Mike with outstretched
      hand.</i>) I am very glad to see you Mr.&mdash;Mr. Hanningford.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> Thank you, Miss&mdash;I&rsquo;m very pleased to see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>Sitting r.</i>) I suppose you hardly recognize our
      friend? (<i>Watches her intently without her noticing it. Mike has turned
      away again, and looks down, flicking leg with cane.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Hesitating.</i>) Um! (<i>Laughs.</i>) Well, he&rsquo;s certainly
      altered since we used to go to school together. But yes&mdash;(<i>examining
      his face</i>)&mdash;there&rsquo;s something of the old face left, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> We only arrived from America last night, traveling hard all
      the time. Pretty nearly worked me to death. Dick has&mdash;(<i>with a yawn</i>)&mdash;but
      there, I suppose I should have hurried up pretty smart myself if I&rsquo;d been
      coming home to a fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> You are staying in the village then, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> Yes, we&rsquo;ve put up at Colonel Dexter&rsquo;s&mdash;my uncle&rsquo;s&mdash;slow
      place. (<i>Laughing.</i>) But better than the inn apparently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Oh. then you are the&mdash;Miss Dexter&rsquo;s cousin that Allen&mdash;(<i>pauses
      hesitating</i>)&mdash;was&mdash;was speaking of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> Oh, the young fellow that was there this afternoon&mdash;was
      that Allen? (<i>With a would-be playful laugh.</i>) And who&rsquo;s Allen, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>A little stiffly.</i>) Allen is Mr. Rollitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> Oh, I wish I&rsquo;d known that this afternoon. Dick&rsquo;s been dying
      to see him and his mother all day. I wanted him to wait till the morning,
      but he would come down to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sure Allen and Aunt will both be delighted. (<i>Approaching
      Mike, who still stands aside and looks down.</i>) Won&rsquo;t you be seated, Mr.
      Hanningford? (<i>He makes no sign&mdash;hesitatingly.</i>) Dick. (<i>Mike
      still takes no notice. Luke has risen and crossed with assumed
      carelessness, towards him and nozu from opposite side of him to Deborah
      gives him a sharp kick. Mike starts and looks up.</i>),
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>Turning away carelessly.</i>) Lost in reveries of old
      scenes, Dick, eh? Miss Deacon is asking you if you won&rsquo;t sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> (<i>Sitting L.c.</i>) Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss, I&rsquo;m sure.
      Oh, thank you, I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Going.</i>) I shan&rsquo;t be a minute. They are only somewhere
      about the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit Deborah c. door l. down stage. Luke goes to door, looks off,
      closes door, then goes up to door c., looks off, then closes it. Comes r.
      of Mike, who is l.c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>After waiting an instant, and making sure that no one is
      about.</i>) Try and keep some of your wits about you, Mike&mdash;if you
      don&rsquo;t mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> (<i>Sulkily.</i>) I don&rsquo;t see the darned good of this part of
      the trick, so I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> I&rsquo;m afraid we shall have a rough time if your memory doesn&rsquo;t
      improve. I&rsquo;ve explained to you at least half-a-dozen times that it was as
      a sort of trial canter that I wanted to come here. If anyone in Devon can
      tell who is Dick Hanningford and who isn&rsquo;t it will be these Rollitts. If
      you pass here you pass anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> Well, it&rsquo;s the very place I should have avoided, and for the
      same reason. The old woman knew Dick Hanningford as well as she knows her
      own son, and I&rsquo;d rather avoid her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke, (<i>r.</i>) You&rsquo;re bound to meet her sooner or later. Better get it
      over and know the worst&mdash;or the best. (<i>Turns away r. a little.</i>)
      Sixteen years make it a little difficult to tell a man, especially between
      the age of nine and twenty-five, and you&rsquo;re like him enough, and always
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> And suppose she gets asking questions&mdash;do I remember
      this, do I remember that&mdash;you know what old women are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> Well, you can&rsquo;t be expected to remember all the details of
      your pinafore days after all this time, and knocking about as you have
      been. You know all that is necessary for you to know. You knew the old
      man, and you were in the house, and you knew young Hanningford. Besides,
      you needn&rsquo;t recollect anything yourself. You recollect what other people
      recollect, that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re wanted to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> (<i>Rising.</i>) I hope we don&rsquo;t make a mess of it! (<i>Turns
      L.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>Crossing and laying his hand on Mike&rsquo;s shoulder, turns
      him to c.</i>) We shan&rsquo;t make a mess of it&mdash;don&rsquo;t you. You know what
      it&rsquo;s for&mdash;£100,000 apiece. I&rsquo;ve done my share of the job&mdash;you do
      yours. (<i>Turns r.a little.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> (<i>Turning round and facing him.</i>) Are you sure you did
      your share?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>l.</i>) What do you mean? (<i>Turns c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> (<i>r.</i>) Are you sure he was dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>After pausing, during which they have looked steadily at
      each other, turning away l.</i>) Well, the bullet went in above his ear,
      because I examined the wound: and his body went over a two hundred-foot
      precipice&mdash;that I could also take an affidavit to&mdash;only I&rsquo;d
      rather not. (<i>Turning round and facing Mike again.</i>) What makes you
      doubt it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;nothing. The idea occurred to me, that&rsquo;s
      all. (<i>Turns l. a little.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> Don&rsquo;t you drink so much and you won&rsquo;t have so many ideas. (<i>After
      a pause, during which he seems troubled, shaking it oft with an effort.</i>)
      Have you got the letters with you? It will look well to take them out
      casually while talking. (<i>Crosses R.; sits on table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MIKE.</b> (<i>Who has crossed to L., taking them out of his breast
      pocket and holding them in his hand.</i>) Yes, here they are all right.
      Bah! (<i>With a shudder.</i>) I always see his face when I look on the
      darned things&mdash;I&mdash;Mrs. R. (<i>Without, loudly.</i>) Dick
      Hanningford&mdash;Dick Hanningford, my boy! (<i>Mike drops suddenly in

      where be thee? (<i>Sees Mike on sofa; making towards him.</i>) Ah, there
      thee be&mdash;I thought I&rsquo;d know thee again though thee wur only in

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>Motioning her back with her arm, but not turning and
      speaking in a quick, excited, loud tone.</i>) Keep back, child, don&rsquo;t come
      near. (<i>Luke is near Mike down c.</i>)
    </p>

      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Springing forward.</i>) Mother! What&rsquo;s the matter?

      ACT II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scene: <i>Morning room in a handsome flat&mdash;a showily furnished room&mdash;rather
      ostentatious and loud in its decoration and appointments. Large table in
      bay window r.upper corner. Fire-place r.Doors at back l.c. and two in l.
      wing. Small tables r.and L.. Easy chairs l. and R.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Breakfast is laid on large table&mdash;it is a gorgeously laid meal&mdash;silver
      and plate in profusion, and a great number of dishes&mdash;tea urn and
      coffee urn&mdash;a boiling kettle&mdash;flowers and ferns in vases and
      stands. One, a large wavy one, is at left edge of table close to Allen.
      The table in short is crowded and showy to the last degree. A magnificent
      footman in gorgeous livery is standing behind; and Mr. Piffin in solemn
      black waits close to Allen&rsquo;s chair, a dish in his hand. Allen is
      discovered sitting l. of table, and eating his breakfast in a most
      melancholy fashion. He looks intensely miserable and awed. The terrible
      solemnity of the whole affair has depressed his spirits to their lowest
      ebb. He glances nervously now and then as the meal proceeds, from the
      footman to the valet, and vice versa, as they silently and with much
      ceremony walk about and wait on him. The fern by his side keeps getting in
      his way, tickling and irritating him, but he dare not move it. He eats in
      silence, and when he does speak, does so in a humble, deprecating, nervous
      manner. He is dressed in a loose morning costume. Music to open Act.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>Standing by Allen&rsquo;s l. elbow c. Peters r. of table R.</i>)
      May I get you a little pâté de foie gras, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Looking round, and speaking in a hushed voice.</i>) I
      beg pardon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> A little pâté de foie gras, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Patty who?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Goose&rsquo;s liver, sir. I think you will like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> No, thanks; I never eats liver. It don&rsquo;t agree with me. I
      will have a bit o&rsquo; the bacon though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> No, sir; it is not dressed that way, sir. I would get used to
      it if I were you, sir. You will so often come across it. Peters, just pass
      your master the pâté de foie gras.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Peters goes to do so. Allen who has turned again towards his breakfast
      is about to take up some gravy from his plate with his knife</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>Checks him.</i>) I wouldn&rsquo;t lap up the gravy with my
      knife, sir. I don&rsquo;t think. It&rsquo;s never done now in good society, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> It&mdash;it&rsquo;s the best part of it, you know, I alius thinks&mdash;the
      gravy
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Yes, it&rsquo;s very tasty, sir. It&rsquo;s unfortunate it&rsquo;s so sloppy;
      and you see, sir, eating it in that way does not show off the figure to
      advantage. Peters, remove your master&rsquo;s plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Peters does so, placing it a few feet beyond Allen&rsquo;s left hand. Allen
      watches it with jealous eyes. Peters then holds the pâté de foie gras to
      Allen. He slowly runs his eye up Peters with awe, and then looks at the
      pâté de foie gras, then using one hand attempts to take it. Peters, not
      moving a muscle, holds it tight. Allen seems surprised, and partly rising,
      attempts to take it with both hands.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>Coming to his rescue, cutting a piece, and putting it on
      his plate.</i>) Allow me, sir. Peters, the brown bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PET.</b> (<i>Looking for it.</i>) It is not on the table, sir.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Crosses l. and rings bell. Peters also crosses l.c. door, Allen looks
      cautiously round and sees they are not watching him, and stealthily
      reaches over and secures a knifeful of gravy. He is about having a second
      and has the knife close to his mouth, when he becomes aware that Piff has
      returned and is watching him. He tries to hide the knife out of sight.
      Peters has returned with bread and butter.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>Severely.</i>) Peters, remove your master&rsquo;s knife. Don&rsquo;t
      you see that it is in his way?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Peters does so, and then holds the bread and butter to Allen, who
      takes a thin slice, folds it up, and holds it in his left hand while
      taking the pâté on a fork in his right. He puts first the pâté and then
      the bread and butter into his mouth and swallows them.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> I must apologize for serving you your breakfast in here, sir.
      Of course, you will not have it in the drawing-room as a rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> No, a&rsquo; coorse not. No; us alius used to have it in the
      kitchen at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Yes, sir. Must have been very convenient. But I think I&rsquo;ll
      get you to put up with the breakfast parlour in future, sir&mdash;when the
      room&rsquo;s ready. Have you quite finished, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Humbly suggesting.</i>) I think I&rsquo;d like a little more
      o&rsquo; that pie. (<i>Looking longingly at pie the other side of table.</i>)
      You see, I alius wur a hearty eater. (<i>Said as apology</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Yes, sir, I&rsquo;m delighted to hear it, sir; but I wouldn&rsquo;t eat
      any more breakfast, sir. You will find it is considered correct among <i>bons
      vivants</i> to eat a very sparse dejeuner. My late lamented master, the
      Count de Fizziani, never partook of anything but a cup of weak tea and a
      little dry toast, and he was one of the oldest families in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Allen rises, Peters bows as he does so, and Allen returns the bow and
      comes dozen R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Ah, I shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought as anyone could &lsquo;a&rsquo; lived
      long on that. (<i>He bows</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> No necessity to bow, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> He did it. (<i>Indicating Peters</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> He&rsquo;s paid for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I allus seem to want a good feed myself in the morning. (<i>Takes
      out an old clay pipe and prepares to fill it. Goes down r. and sits in
      chair. Peters is clearing away the breakfast things</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Are you thinking of smoking, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Yes; I allus has a whiff or two arter breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> It&rsquo;s very soothing, sir. My late lamented master, the Count
      de Fizziani, used to follow precisely the same course. But I wouldn&rsquo;t
      smoke a pipe, sir. Pipes are going out in good society. (<i>Takes
      cigarette case from pocket and offers it to Allen. Takes pipe from Allen
      and puts it on corner of table R.c.</i>) I have some cigarettes here, sir,
      which I think you will like, sir. These are much more <i>comme il faut</i>,
      sir. This case is a present from my late lamented master, the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Allen looks at them and gingerly takes one.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Which end?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>Lighting match.</i>) Either end, sir. Allow me. (<i>Showing
      matchbox.</i>) Another little souvenir from my late master. He was always
      acknowledging, if I may say so, my value to him. That sort of thing is
      always done in good society now. (<i>Lights cigarette.</i>) It is a full
      flavored one, sir. (<i>Piffin takes Allen&rsquo;s pipe from table r.c., crossing
      with it to window r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Watching him, anxiously.</i>) Don&rsquo;t hurt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>Turning round.</i>) I was just going to put it outside on
      the window-sill, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> No, don&rsquo;t put him there. We used to sit up together of a
      night watching the sheep. I don&rsquo;t like the thought of putting him outside
      the window, now I&rsquo;m a gentleman. Drop him in the pocket of that old
      shooting coat o&rsquo; mine that thee won&rsquo;t let me wear. They know each other. (<i>Sits
      r.and smokes his cigarette. Piff. puts the pipe on table and returns r.c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>Noticing that Allen is looking at his cigarette.</i>) All
      right, sir? (<i>r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Yes&mdash;yes, thank you, Mr. Puffin&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> You will soon get to like them, sir. And whenever you are
      ready to dress, sir&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Dress? Why, I be dressed, bain&rsquo;t I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Oh, only for breakfast, you see, sir. I understood you were
      going out walking, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Why can&rsquo;t I walk in these?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Oh, no, sir&mdash;all London would laugh at you.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> I am naughty, I know&mdash;but papa leaves everything to me,

    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>After a pause, rises, goes to Clara&mdash;kindly.</i>) I
      didn&rsquo;t mean to speak unkind, lass. I&rsquo;m full of old-fashioned notions about

      charge by somebody, that&rsquo;s certain. (<i>Allen rises, puts some notes from
      his pocket-book into hers, and hands it back to her.</i>) I owe your
      father a little over one or two bets. I can take it off that and give him
      the rest, like. (<i>Crosses to l.</i>)

    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> Nothing. I&rsquo;m not used to your sort of men. (<i>Goes to
      fireplace, then up R., throwing off her seriousness and turning towards

      comes and slays the dragon and sets the frightened princess free from all
      her trouble. (<i>Laughing.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Goes to table r. Clara r.c. at top of table.</i>) When
      art thee going to gie me the right to be thy knight always?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b>.(<i>Sits at table playfully.</i>) Ah, the gallant knights
      are apt to turn into grim jailers&mdash;(<i>comes l. of r. table</i>)&mdash;when
      they get the princess into their own castles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Can&rsquo;t thee believe me, Clara? Trust me, lass&mdash;I&rsquo;m only
      a rough country chap to be asking a beautiful lady like thee to be my
      wife. But if I can&rsquo;t gie thee anything very showy on the outside, it will
      make me the more eager alius to keep a loving heart for thee within.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> Oh, no. (<i>Sits in chair l. of table.</i>) A lover on his
      knees is so much nicer than a lover on your arm. You are so nice, Allen,
      as you are, you can&rsquo;t think. I really couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to risk a
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>c.</i>) It would be a change for thee, Clara&mdash;(<i>leans

      rough and troubled road to one where every stone wur smoothed away from
      your path&mdash;-where every thorn wur held back as you passed&mdash;where,
      instead of care for the day and dread for the morrow, thee would feel that
      a strong arm wur round thee&mdash;that a loving hand wur working out thy
      life for thee. Cannot thee risk the change, Clara?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Rises, Allen takes her right hand, turns away R.</i>)
      Ah, I suppose there are such lives for some women. It must be very good
      when you are tired. (<i>Facing round to L.c.</i>) And you, Allen&mdash;women
      do not always seem so charming after marriage as they did before. It might
      be a risk for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> To have the sweetest, noblest woman in the world to be my

      her veins&mdash;whose nursery was the gambling house&mdash;whose school
      was the Café and the Boulevards&mdash;a woman who earned her daily bread
      by shamelessness and cunning&mdash;a woman whose past would ever follow
      like a shadow the footsteps of her life&mdash;whose future must ever be a
      darker shadow still. Ah, Allen, take care. Cupid ties a bandage over men&rsquo;s
      eyes. Hymen, when it is too late, plucks it off. Hadn&rsquo;t you better lift a
      corner off the handkerchief, Allen, while we are yet upon the step
      without, lest beside your hearth, when the door has shut us in, you cast
      it loose, to find I am a stain upon your name&mdash;a shadow in your home&mdash;a

      game&mdash;it is earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> Then I would suggest to you that your cousin is quite
      capable of taking care of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Yes, against a man; but not against the woman he loves and
      trusts. It is his love that enables you to deceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Crossing to R.&mdash;sits on chair near table r.</i>)
      You seem to have made up your mind, my dear child, that I am deceiving
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>l.c.</i>) I know that he has asked you to become his wife,
      and I know that although you have let him think it is all right, you have
      never given him a real answer. I know that you accept his attentions, his
      invitations, his presents. (<i>Noticing the book and notes on the table,
      points to them.</i>) And all the while you are having whispered interviews
      and secret meetings with another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Coolly counting notes.</i>) If you are thinking of the
      conversation you were trying to listen to just now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> That is only the latest of many such I have noticed. They
      began three months ago, down in Devonshire. I come to London and find the
      same thing going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Sneering.</i>)&rsquo; You really ought to have been a
      detective, the force might have been some use then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> I&rsquo;m not blind. (<i>Goes c.</i>) Allen is. But that is not all.
      These things might be explained by themselves&mdash;suspicious though they
      are&mdash;but just now, going downstairs, I picked up a purse. (<i>Pausing
      and looking at Clara, who, however, makes no sign.</i>) It is your purse.
      (<i>Throws it into Clara&rsquo;s lap.</i>) I opened it to see whom it belonged
      to&mdash;and inside it is a wedding ring. Is your name Dexter or
      Cranbourne?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Rising.</i>) I really must decline to answer any
      questions of yours. You are so exceedingly rude. (<i>Crosses up behind
      table R.c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> You need not answer me. Answer Allen. Tell him that you will
      be his wife&mdash;or that you cannot. (<i>Clara takes no notice.</i>) Do
      you refuse? (<i>Crossing l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> I refuse to be dictated to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Then I shall communicate my suspicions to Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Turning fiercely.</i>) Do so. Tell him&mdash;(<i>walks
      round table to back of Deb. c.</i>)&mdash;that you believe that I am the
      wife of another man, and am playing a shameful part with him merely to
      sponge on him. That I am fondling him with the one hand only the better to
      pick his pocket with the other. Tell him that you believe he is surrounded
      by a gang of adventurers and thieves, of which I am the willing decoy.
      Tell him your suspicions, and I will tell him that they are the poisonous
      concoctions of a jealous woman&mdash;of a woman who loves him herself&mdash;(<i>laughs</i>)&mdash;and
      seeks to win him from her more favored rival, by lies and trickery. (<i>Goes
      dozen r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Quietly.</i>) You shall answer him for all that, or he
      shall know the reason why you dare not. (<i>Crosses L., and calls.</i>)
      Allen! Allen!

    <p>
      (<i>Enter Allen l. up stage</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>l. c.</i>) Allen, is Miss Dexter engaged to be married to
      you or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>l.</i>) Well. (<i>Laughs.</i>) Blest if I could tell &lsquo;ee
      that, Deb. That be the very thing I ha&rsquo; been trying to find out myself.
      Bain&rsquo;t it, Clara? Only her be such a tease. (<i>All said laughingly.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Sharply.</i>) You mean you have never been able to get a
      plain answer, yes or no?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Gently, lass. Thee be mistaking this for some business of
      thine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Allen, we&rsquo;ve been like brother and sister all our lives, and
      your happiness is my happiness. I have my reasons&mdash;very strong
      reasons&mdash;for asking you to ask Miss Dexter now, before me, whether
      she will be your wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I can&rsquo;t say I thank thee, Deb, for interfering in a matter
      that don&rsquo;t concern thee. (<i>To Clara, crossing to her.</i>) I hope,
      Clara, you don&rsquo;t think as I have any hand in this, but as things stand
      now, it will perhaps be best (<i>advancing</i>) if I do ask thee. Will
      thee be my wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Crosses down. Very quietly and deliberately.</i>) Yes! (<i>Stepping
      forward and, putting her hand in Allen&rsquo;s, c. A pause. She then, glancing
      first at Deb., draws Allen slowly to her, and they kiss. They cross r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I think now, Deb, that Miss Dexter has a right to know thy
      &ldquo;reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> They were mistaken ones, Allen. Please forgive me, both of
      you.

      mean?

    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> I will tell you some time. Never mind now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Ah, well, us oughtn&rsquo;t to be angry with her, anyhow, for what
      her&rsquo;s done. (<i>Takes Clara&rsquo;s hand in his.</i>) Ought us? (<i>Draws her to
      him and kisses her forehead</i>).

      himself.</i>) Ah, no, it be real enough. (<i>Looks round.</i>) Ah, they

      thee a bumper, Fortune lass. (<i>Turns to table r., On which are wine and

    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Have you seen my cub about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PETERS.</b> (<i>Without looking up.</i>) No, Foxey, I ain&rsquo;t. Didn&rsquo;t
      know as you had had one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>c.</i>) You know who I mean&mdash;your master. Peters. (<i>Going
      to door c.</i>) Not far off from where yours is I suppose.

    <p>
      (<i>Exit Peters c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Um! The master has been getting impertinent to me of late, so
      the servants seem to be following suit. (<i>Shrugging his shoulders.</i>)
      I shall throw this job up when I&rsquo;ve made another hundred or two. I wonder
      how much longer he&rsquo;s going to keep me waiting.

      manner. He has a huge pewter pot in one hand and a large church-warden
      clay pipe alight in the other. He looks round stealthily, listens, then
      crosses nervously and sits l. in easy chair. He stretches himself out as
      luxuriously as his tight clothes will allow&mdash;especially the collar.
      Takes a long pull at the pot and long puffs at the pipe. In the middle of
      each pull, grunts &ldquo;good&rdquo; in evident enjoyment.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Chuckling in a deep undertone. Crosses to c. and sits.</i>)
      Ah-h-h, I&rsquo;ve done un this time. He&rsquo;s waiting upstairs to curl my hair. (<i>Chuckling

      conducting my correspondence. (<i>Chuckles, pulls at pipe, and takes a

    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> What do thee want? Didn&rsquo;t I tell &rsquo;ee I wur going to
      conduct my correspondence, and that I didn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> (<i>Goes up table.</i>) I beg pardon, sir, but I thought
      maybe you had completed your correspondence, especially as there was only
      one letter this morning, and that was a circular about coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Oh, did you. Well, I ain&rsquo;t you see. I&rsquo;m going to write a lot
      of original correspondence this morning, and I&rsquo;m collecting my thoughts. (<i>Goes
      on smoking sulkily.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Yes, sir&mdash;certainly, sir&mdash;but might I be allowed to
      suggest, sir, that a pot of ale and a clay pipe are hardly the <i>dolce
      far niente</i> of a <i>grand seigneur</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Hardly the what of my which? Look here, don&rsquo;t you be so spry
      at calling me them jaw-breaking foreign names, because I don&rsquo;t like it. It
      wur only yesterday you alluded to me as a <i>bo-mo</i>, and last week you
      said I ought to be in the <i>hot tongs</i>. I didn&rsquo;t say anything at the
      time, but you drop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> I referred to you as belonging to the <i>beau monde</i>, sir,
      and I may have said your position was now among the <i>haut ton</i>. We
      always talk like that in good society, sir. Both expressions were
      flattering, very flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Ah, maybe they wur and maybe they wurn&rsquo;t. Next time, you
      call it me in English, and then I can judge for myself. And don&rsquo;t worrit
      me to-day at all. I&rsquo;ve got a trying morning before me, and I&rsquo;m going to
      have a little quiet enjoyment to set myself up before it begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Might I suggest, then, sir, that a cigarette and a little
      absinthe would be more <i>de rigueur?</i> My late lamented master the
      Count de Fizziani invariably took a little absinthe after breakfast and
      found great benefit from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Yes, I know. I tried your friend&rsquo;s cough mixture before, you
      know. Old ale&rsquo;s good enough for me.

      <b>ALLEN.</b> Don&rsquo;t you worrit. I&rsquo;ve been a gentleman for a month; I think
      I might have a morning off.

    <p>
      <b>PIFF.</b> Very well, sir. Just as you please, of course, sir; but I&rsquo;ve
      my character to consider, sir&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I am not
      accustomed to the service of gentlemen with pothouse proclivities.

    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Springing up, working Piff. round, from table l. to desk
      r.</i>) Oh, you go to your late lamented master, the fizzing Count, and
      tell him to&mdash;I have had eno&rsquo; of him and I&rsquo;ve had eno&rsquo; of you. Blest
      if I&rsquo;ve had a happy moment since you came into the house. You&rsquo;ve dressed
      me up like a tailor&rsquo;s dummy, and curled my hair like a Sunday school kid;
      you&rsquo;ve made me talk like a man in a play, and walk like a monkey on
      stilts. Thee&rsquo;ve chivied me about from morning till night, and thee&rsquo;ve
      rammed that old lamented corpse of yours down my throat every two minutes
      of the day. I&rsquo;ve put up wi&rsquo; it all for a long while because I thought thee
      meant well, and wur a-trying to make me into a gentleman, but blest if I
      think thee knows much more about the genuine article than I does, and I&rsquo;m
      going to go it in my own way now. Look here. (<i>Takes off his tie and

      waistcoat, kicks off his boots, and throws himself into easy chair, sticks
      his feet on table, takes long pull from the pot, slams it on table> again,
      and commences to smoke his pipe vigorously, looking defiantly at Piff.</i>)

      gentleman after all. Some of us was built for gaiters, and some on us for
      patent leather shoes, and I be one of the gaiter sort&mdash;all my tastes
      are low. I doan&rsquo;t like claret and I doan&rsquo;t like cigarettes. I&rsquo;m
      uncomfortable in a collar (<i>picking his up and fixing it</i>) and I
      prefer shove-ha&rsquo;penny to billiards. (<i>Sighs, continues dreamily.</i>)
      Ah, I&rsquo;d gie a trifle to be going to spend this evening at the Dunkery Arms
      a-halping to sing a chorus with old Joe Steddles and young Jem Whalley and
      Jack Clouter. Ah, he&rsquo;d got a fine voice, had old Jack Clouter. Never heard
      a man sing so loud in all my life. Lord, I shall never forget her&rsquo;s doing
      &ldquo;Rock me to sleep, mother,&rdquo; round at the lodge, and a waking up mother
      Hammond&rsquo;s three kids just as her&rsquo;d got un all off to sleep. Lord, how her

    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> Yes&mdash;most carefully&mdash;and they certainly make the
      story appear very plausible&mdash;very plausible, indeed. Have you said
      anything to your mother?

      <b>ALLEN.</b> No&mdash;no, I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word to anybody
      until I was sure one way or t&rsquo;other. (<i>Sits L.</i>)

      aback I couldn&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;ee what it wur, but thee&rsquo;ll see him for

      he comes.

      <b>ALLEN.</b> Good-morning. (<i>Motioning to Purt., who is l.</i>) Mr.
      Purtwee, the gentleman I spoke of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> Good-morning, (<i>c. and then coming r.sits L.c.</i>) Guess
      I&rsquo;m not a particularly welcome visitor here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>r.</i>) Well, I owns as I&rsquo;ve come across folks as I&rsquo;ve
      felt more at home wi&rsquo;. (<i>Allen sits R.</i>) But I suppose we&rsquo;ve got to
      get used to &rsquo;ee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> Well now, gentlemen, we&rsquo;ve come for business and must not
      waste time. Mr. Rollitt has told you who I am, and if you are Richard
      Hanningford I shall be only too anxious for you to have your rights. But
      then, my dear sir, I shall want to be very sure that you are Richard
      Hanningford.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> That&rsquo;s right and square. I&rsquo;ve got to prove it, I know, and I
      don&rsquo;t say that it will be an easy job.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> At present you see we have nothing but your bare word for it.
      You say this man who called himself Richard Hanningford and who died at
      Mrs. Rollitt&rsquo;s was an impostor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> And a damned scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> Quite so, if he were not Richard Hanningford, he must have
      been. But then if he were Richard Hanningford&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> Why then, I am the damned scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> Well&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t going to say that&mdash;but one of you
      must be the right Hanningford&mdash;and the other the wrong one&mdash;and
      if we made a mistake three months ago we don&rsquo;t want to make another now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>r.</i>) You see it ain&rsquo;t so much the money I care about.
      There was a time that I thought it would be a grand thing to be rich, but
      now I&rsquo;ve tried it, danged if I see so much fun in it as I thought there
      wur. (<i>Rises.</i>) It ain&rsquo;t only that: it&rsquo;s the girl I love&mdash;if I
      lose the money, I loses her. I can&rsquo;t expect her to have me wi&rsquo;out it.
      She&rsquo;s a lady&mdash;I&rsquo;m only a country bumpkin and I know it. With this
      money I can win her and make her life happy&mdash;even if she doesn&rsquo;t much
      care for me. If I were sure you were Dick Hanningford, I&rsquo;d gie it up. But
      I ain&rsquo;t sure and I&rsquo;m going to fight&mdash;that&rsquo;s plain. (<i>Turns and
      crosses r. Sits R.c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>Coes to Allen r.c.</i>) Plain and sensible, and I don&rsquo;t
      like you any the less for it; but I am Dick Hanningford, and the money&rsquo;s
      mine, and I&rsquo;m going to have a good fight to get it. (<i>Coes l. puts foot

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>Fiercely&mdash;takes foot off chair.</i>) He&rsquo;d been my
      chum for over two years&mdash;the cur&mdash;and knew everything about me&mdash;I
      saved his life when the gang were going to hang him&mdash;he shared my
      diggings when we were in the mining lay, and he had half my blanket every
      night when we were with the cattle. And I trusted him&mdash;the skunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> What was his name?

    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> Cassidy&mdash;Dan Cassidy. (<i>Sits again.</i>)

      <b>HANN.</b> I suppose so.

    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> Like me! Not at all!

    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> Oh, yes, my dear sir, I never saw him alive, but his features
      were yours one for one.

    <p>
      (<i>Purt. and Allen exchange glances.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Well, all I know is, that if the man who called himself
      Richard Hanningford, and who fell down dead in my mother&rsquo;s kitchen three
      months ago was standing beside you now, nobody would know which wur you
      and which wur him. .

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PETERS.</b> Mr. Luke Cranbourne is downstairs, sir, and would like to
      see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Oh, bother Luke Cranbourne&mdash;tell him I&rsquo;m out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PETERS.</b> Yes, sir. (<i>Going. As he is by door.</i>)
    </p>

      <b>ALLEN.</b> Stop! (<i>Peters turns.</i>) Ask Mr. Cranbourne to come back
      in a quarter of an hour. (<i>Looks at watch.</i>)

    <p>
      <b>PETERS.</b> Yes, sir. (<i>Exit c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> What sort of a man was Dan Cassidy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> A pale, dark-eyed man with a long black beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Would you know him again without the black beard, and under
      another name?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>Fiercely.</i>) Know him! Will you bring me face to face
      with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Maybe I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>c.</i>) See here! I&rsquo;ve lived among a set that like to
      wipe off a score, no matter what the price. You put that man into my hands
      so that justice may be done on him, and we share the old man&rsquo;s money
      between us. (<i>Crosses R.</i>)
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Crosses to Purt. Hann. goes R.</i>) Yes I do. He&rsquo;s been
      no friend of mine. Is it a bargain?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> Yes. Without Dan Cassidy my case might be hard to prove. With
      him it would be easy. £100,000 and my revenge are good enough for me. You
      give me that. (<i>Goes to extreme R.</i>)

      stands r.c.</i>)

    <p>
      <b>DEX.</b> Beg pardon, my dear boy. Found the door open (<i>Allen goes up
      c. to Dex.</i>) and took the liberty of an old friend to walk in. Thought
      I should find you alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Crosses up c.</i>) Shall be in a minute, Colonel, if you
      will excuse me. (<i>Draws the two men together near fireplace, Allen
      nearest, Purt. next, Hann. r.</i>) Can thee play billiards?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> I can, but I don&rsquo;t crave for them at this particular moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> You&rsquo;ll just have time to play fifty up afore the man as I
      takes to be Dan Cassidy is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> How will you let us know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Looks round thinking, then catches sight of glasses on
      table l.; takes one up and holds it over hearth.</i>) Keep thee, ears
      open, and when thee hears this glass fall and break, open the door and

      want? Glad to see thee, thee know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEX.</b> (<i>l.c.</i>) Nothing, dear boy&mdash;nothing for myself. I
      have only brought a letter from my little girl, and am to take back an
      answer. (<i>Produces letter and hands to Allen.</i>) I&rsquo;m only Cupid to you
      young folks. Ha! Hat Only Cupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Ah, they usen&rsquo;t to wrap &rsquo;em up so much when I wur
      young. (<i>Crosses R., opens and reads letter.</i>)
    </p>

      anything to me afterwards until I pay you back, as I shall be so ashamed
      of it. I send papa with this. He knows nothing about it, so please don&rsquo;t
      tell him&mdash;he is so proud.&mdash;(<i>Allen looks at Dex., who turns
      away and tries to assume airy unconsciousness</i>)&mdash;and would be so

      when she wrote this?
    </p>

      queer&mdash;very shaky indeed&mdash;and she seemed very much worried, too,
      she wouldn&rsquo;t tell me what about. She tries to keep all her trouble away
      from her old father, dear child. (<i>Enter Clara unseen by either.</i>)
      Ah, I know how anxiously she&rsquo;s waiting for me now. &ldquo;Come back soon, dear,

      it to Dex. Clara steps forward and takes it.</i>)

      strangle you. I&rsquo;ll murder you. She&rsquo;s only trying it on to see what you

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Falling on her knees before him.</i>) Forgive me, Allen,
      you don&rsquo;t know what my life has been. Dragged up among thieves and
      sharpers, taught to trick and lie before I could speak plainly, I have
      never know what truth and honor meant except as a dim longing. All the
      humanity&mdash;all the womanhood&mdash;has been dried out of me till I am

      mean to do it. Come! I be more sorry for thee than for myself. I could see

    </p>
    <p>
      Clara, (<i>l.</i>) Ah, Allen, don&rsquo;t keep speaking kindly to me. Don&rsquo;t

      I knows thy lot&rsquo;s harder than I thought it wur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CLARA.</b> (<i>Turns and looks at Allen.</i>) Try not to think of me at
      all, Allen&mdash;I am not worth it&mdash;forget me. There is one who loves
      you better than I could ever do, and who is good and pure. (<i>Rises.</i>)
      You men never see the love that is under your feet&mdash;you reach only

      only human being I have to cling to&mdash;and he is good to me in his way.
      (<i>Looks up at Allen.</i>) I don&rsquo;t expect we shall ever see each other
      again. For your sake, I wish we had never met&mdash;for myself, my life

      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>Coming down.</i>) How de do, dear boy? (<i>Shaking hands.
      Allen does so listlessly and almost unconsciously.</i>) I wanted to see
      you particularly this morning, before I went to the city. I&rsquo;ve come across
      something that will just double your fortune. Here. (<i>Laying papers on
      table l. and taking up and pouring out a glass of wine.</i>) You do have
      such capital wine, Rollitt, I really must help myself to a glass. It is a
      splendid scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>r.c.</i>) Very like, but we won&rsquo;t discuss it now. (<i>Taking
      notes from his pocket-book.</i>) I want thee to leave by the noon train
      for the Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>Turns round, face to audience, glass in left hand.</i>)
      What&rsquo;s up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Crosses l. c., hands him the notes.</i>) Thy wife can
      join thee there afterwards. (<i>Luke starts and looks hard at Allen.</i>)
      And thee can get away to Australia, or somewhere in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>Defiantly.</i>) And why, pray?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Because there is a man in the next room who be more anxious
      to see thee than thee may be to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> What man?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Richard Hanningford.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Luke lets fall the glass.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Good God! Thee&rsquo;ve given the signal to call him in! Quick! (<i>Luke
      rushes in terror to door at back.</i>) Not that way. (<i>Luke bewildered
      and helpless with fright, turns wildly about like a hunted thing not
      knowing which way to fly. Is about to make for other door, when handle of
      door at back is heard to move.</i>) Too late&mdash;keep where thee art.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LUKE.</b> (<i>Clinging to Allen&rsquo;s arm.</i>) Save me! (<i>Allen thrusts
      him behind door at c. as it opens and enter Hann. and Purt. following.
      Allen goes r. Hann. comes down and stands c. Purt. remains near door and
      is about to close it.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Who has moved down to r.c., nervously, with effort to
      appear calm and careless.</i>) Leave the door, Mr. Purtwee, leave the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> Wide open? (<i>Surprised.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s fearfully hot in here! (<i>Wiping his brow.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>Looking at him suspiciously.</i>) I don&rsquo;t find it so. I
      think we&rsquo;ll have it shut over this job. (<i>Turns to door.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Eagerly.</i>) No, no! Don&rsquo;t shut it&mdash;don&rsquo;t shut it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> Why not? (<i>Looks hard at Allen.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Why&mdash;why&mdash;don&rsquo;t I tell you. It&rsquo;s so close&mdash;so&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Hann. crosses, goes to door c. and locks it, then returns, eyeing
      Allen sternly. Luke has crept behind the curtain, which hangs like a
      pillar by the side of the door. Allen watches with intense suspense.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>c.</i>) Well&mdash;you gave the signal!
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Allen r.c. a little to front of Hann. He keeps in front of Hann. all
      through the scene until Luke has got away and prevents his turning round&mdash;he
      is very excited but tries to appear careless&mdash;the result being a
      slightly hysterical manner. When Luke comes from behind the curtain and
      while he is crossing Allen catches Hann. by the lapels of his coat and
      holds and works him round so that his back is to Luke. He grows more and
      more eager and intense until Luke is off, when he gradually subsides into
      a quieter manner, but not too suddenly. At Hann&rsquo;s hint that he has had too
      much brandy, he catches at the idea to cover his excitement, to account
      for his conduct.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Yes, my dear fellow&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;I wur going to
      explain to thee&mdash;it wurn&rsquo;t the signal&mdash;it wur an accident. I
      dropped the glass by accident. Thee see I had just had a glass of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> More than one glass, cousin?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Laughs loudly.</i>) Ha! ha! Perhaps it wur two. (<i>First
      movement of Luke.</i>) (<i>At this point Luke creeps from behind curtain,
      Purt. sees him and is about to make an exclamation, when Allen, covering
      his action by assumed drunkenness, lunges half round and catches Purt. on
      his shoulder, clutching it tightly with his left hand while holding Hann.
      with his right&mdash;laughing boisterously all the time. Purt. understands
      and remains silent. Allen grows more and more excited. Laughs.</i>) Well,
      now, look&rsquo;ee here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hanningford. Cousin Dick&mdash;my long lost&mdash;(<i>laughs as before and
      slaps him on the shoulder. Hann. impatient half turns round&mdash;Allen
      seises his coat with both hands and keeps him round.</i>) No&mdash;no&mdash;look
      thee here, Cousin Dick. Now you say this Cassidy, this creeping, crawling,
      lying cur, Dan Cassidy, tried to murder thee&mdash;(<i>Hann. again seems
      as though he would turn round</i>)&mdash;and these papers&mdash;these
      papers that you sent me. Well, I sent &rsquo;em on to Purtwee. Ah, he&rsquo;s a
      sharp one. (<i>Door clicks after Luke&rsquo;s exit.</i>) Purtwee, he&rsquo;ll know
      who&rsquo;s who. He&rsquo;ll put us right. Won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee, Purtwee, old friend?
      Won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee&mdash;won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>He slaps Purt. on back, laughing boisterously and half staggering
      forward into Purt.&lsquo;s arms. Luke has got away by door r., and from now
      Allen&rsquo;s excitement gradually subsides, and an air of exhaustion follows.
      Sits l.c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>c.</i>) Say! Are you drunk or playing the fool? Where&rsquo;s
      this man Cassidy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Pause.</i>) I don&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> Isn&rsquo;t he coming here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> No!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>Angrily.</i>) Didn&rsquo;t you lead me to believe&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> That you should be brought face to face wi&rsquo; him? Yes&mdash;but
      I&rsquo;ve changed my mind since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>After a pause.</i>) I understand: it was only a trick to
      give you time to get him out of the way. You thought that without him I
      should not be able to prove my case. I thought I was dealing with an
      honest man and a friend, and I offered to share the money with you. (<i>With
      tierce anger.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Fiercely, rising.</i>) And I tell you to take the whole
      of it! (<i>A pause&mdash;Hann. steps back and stares at him.</i>) I have
      learnt enough within the last few minutes to believe that you are the man
      you say you are, and if so, take it all. You offered me £100,000 to give
      thee Dan Cassidy, I offer thee £200,000 to let him go his way in peace. (<i>Pause.</i>)
      Come, you may find it hard to prove thee art Hanningford afore the law.
      Prove it to me and Mr. Purtwee, and give me thy hand on it that thee&rsquo;ll
      never seek to find Dan Cassidy or harm him, and thee art old Hanningford&rsquo;s
      heir, and I, Allen Rollitt, farmer and yeoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>After a pause.</i>) Your secrets are your own, cousin.
      I&rsquo;d dearly have loved to have my revenge upon the hound, but if Dan
      Cassidy is worth £100,000 to you, you can have him&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      thought he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> He goes free, so far as you are concerned, for ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> For ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Right, Dick Hanningford! (<i>They grasp hands.</i>) And now
      we&rsquo;ll say good-bye for to-day if you don&rsquo;t mind. Mr. Purtwee will see thee
      to-morrow, and arrange things. I&rsquo;d like to be quiet a bit just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> You&rsquo;ve had a rough morning, cousin, and I guess the kindest
      thing I can do is to take myself off. Good-bye. (<i>Shakes hands.</i>)
      Good-bye, Mr. Purtwee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> Good-bye, Mr. Hanningford; I will write to you to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HANN.</b> (<i>Goes to door c.</i>) No hurry. Good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> Well, I can&rsquo;t understand you, my boy. It&rsquo;s really a very
      Quixotic thing to do. Why shouldn&rsquo;t the man suffer for his crime?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>l.</i>) Because he can&rsquo;t suffer without bringing
      suffering to them as I&rsquo;d rather spare&mdash;because he&rsquo;s the husband of
      the woman I have been calling Clara Dexter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> (<i>Astonished.</i>) You don&rsquo;t say that, lad! When did you
      learn it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> About five minutes ago. (<i>Crosses to r.; leans on chair.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> (<i>After a pause.</i>) Hanningford said true; it&rsquo;s been a
      rough morning for you. (<i>Going up to Allen and laying his hand on his
      shoulder.</i>) Would you rather that I stopped with you a bit, lad, or
      left you alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Leave me alone, old friend. (<i>Purt. goes to c. door.</i>)
      I shall be off soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PURT.</b> (<i>At door c.</i>) Where are you going to?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> I&rsquo;m going back to Woodbarrow Farm. I&rsquo;ve had eno&rsquo; of the big
      world. I&rsquo;ve had enough of fine folks and their ways. I&rsquo;m going back to my
      own people&mdash;I&rsquo;m going back to see the faces of them as I know loves
      me, to feel the hands of them as I know thinks well of me&mdash;I&rsquo;m going
      back home.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Purt. exit R., Allen stands l. by fire, stage darkens, and scene

      Scene 2. Same as Act I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Time:</i> evening, fire burning brightly, and lamp lit on table, where
      supper is laid. Deb. discovered by fire, attending to cooking operations;
      Mrs. R. by fire, laying supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Be it done, lass?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Who is kneeling down, looking into oven.</i>) Yes, aunt,
      just to a turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>Crossing and looking over Deb&rsquo;s shoulder.</i>) Ah, that
      be just right. Thee&rsquo;s a good cook, lass. (<i>Crossing back to table.</i>)
      Ah, how un used to like a veal pasty. (<i>Sighs.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> It&rsquo;s a bad thing going to bed, though, ain&rsquo;t it, aunt?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Ah, anything be bad for them as ain&rsquo;t got no stomachs, and
      underdone bricks be all right for them as has. (<i>Gets dishes from
      dresser; lays table.</i>) Besides, we bain&rsquo;t going to bed yet. Us&rsquo;ll sit
      and have a chat after supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> It seems so lonely of an evening here now. (<i>Looking into
      fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>In front of table r.c.</i>) So it do, lass. (<i>Crossing
      L.</i>) Ah, the lads bean&rsquo;t so big to look at, but they leaves a rare
      space behind &rsquo;em when they goes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>After a pause, still gazing dreamily into fire.</i>) I
      wonder if he&rsquo;ll ever come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Aye, aye; he&rsquo;ll come back, never fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> (<i>Turns.</i>) What, to stop?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>l. sits on settle.</i>) Ah, to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> What makes you think so, aunt?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> I dunno. It&rsquo;s never seemed real to me, any on it. I&rsquo;m
      awaiting every day to hear un lift the latch and walk in to find as it had
      all been a dream. So I alius lays for three (<i>l.</i>)

      (<i>Enter Allen c. He is dressed much as in Act 1. He shuts the door and
      stands by it.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Well, mother, (<i>c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>l. staring at him.</i>) Allen, lad! (<i>Bewildered, not
      grasping it. Deb. having risen, stands with the hot pie that she has that
      moment taken from the oven, transfixed R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>At door c.</i>) I&rsquo;ve come home, you see, to stop&mdash;for
      good. Are thee glad to see me, mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> (<i>l.</i>) Come home! To stop! For good! Ah! (<i>Rushes
      across with a cry of joy and hugs him up c.</i>) I said he would&mdash;I
      said he would&mdash;I said he would. My boy! My boy! (<i>After a pause.</i>)
      And&mdash;and all the money, and&mdash;and Miss Dexter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> (<i>Taking off his hat and throwing it down at hack.</i>)
      Shadows, mother, that have passed away, out of my life, for ever. I&rsquo;ll
      tell thee all about it later on, never mind to-night. Let&rsquo;s think only
      about ourselves. (<i>Going to Deb. r.</i>) Are thee glad to see me?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Mrs. R. pushes them together from behind r. Deb. still with pie in her
      hands, puts her face up. Allen bends and kisses it. Mrs. R. catches the
      two in her arms, and embraces both at once, laughing. Deb. holds pie out
      at arm&rsquo;s length to save it.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Mind the pie, mother.

      <b>MRS. R.</b> Bless un, and thee&rsquo;ve come back just in time for supper, as
      thee alius used to. (<i>Laughs, sits up stage, top of table.</i>) Can thee
      eat veal pasty?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> Can I eat veal&mdash;(<i>taking off overcoat and throwing it
      on chair r. c.</i>) Let me get at un, that&rsquo;s all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Poor boy! Come and sit &rsquo;ee down. (<i>Pushing him in
      chair l. of table.</i>) Where be the potatoes, Deb.?

    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Well, have a look in the saucepan, then. (<i>Sits back of
      table r. c. Allen l. Deb. r.</i>) Thee won&rsquo;t find &lsquo;em by turning round and
      round. Now come lad, and get a bit inside thee. Us&rsquo;ll do the talking
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Deb. potters about between fire and table in a bewildered manner. She
      brings potatoes, and puts them in front of Allen.</i>)

      <b>ALLEN.</b> Ah, it do smell lovely, don&rsquo;t it? (<i>Sniffing at pie.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MRS. R.</b> Never thee mind smelling it, thee taste it. Lud, how thin
      thee art looking, lad. (<i>To Deb. who is almost doing so.</i>) Don&rsquo;t pour
      the beer into the pie, child, and look where thee&rsquo;s put the potatoes! (<i>Takes
      jug away from her.</i>)

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> What, the one as used to squint?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Yes, Parsons left his shot on the pigstye wall, and she ate
      two ounces. Oh, and you remember Jim?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ALLEN.</b> What, the bantam?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DEB.</b> Yes. He&rsquo;s given his own father such a licking, and won&rsquo;t let

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
